- [x] Troubleshooting guides are available
- [x] All documentation is up to date

## Local Testing Checklist

### 1. Dependency Installation
```bash
# Should complete without errors
pnpm install
```
**Expected Result**: All dependencies installed successfully

### 2. Linting Check
```bash
# Should pass with zero warnings
pnpm lint
```
**Expected Result**: ✅ All packages pass linting

### 3. Test Execution
```bash
# Should run tests for all packages
pnpm test
```
**Expected Result**: ✅ All tests pass

### 4. Coverage Check
```bash
# Should generate coverage reports
pnpm test:coverage
```
**Expected Result**: ✅ Coverage reports generated, 85% threshold enforced

### 5. Build Verification
```bash
# Should build all packages successfully
pnpm build
```
**Expected Result**: ✅ All packages build without errors

### 6. Clean Operation
```bash
# Should clean build artifacts
pnpm clean
```
**Expected Result**: ✅ Build artifacts removed

## CI/CD Pipeline Testing

### GitHub Actions Validation
1. **Create Test Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/ci-validation
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: validate CI/CD implementation"
   git push origin test/ci-validation
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Target: `staging` branch
   - Verify all status checks are triggered
   - Confirm required checks: `lint`, `test`, `build`

3. **Monitor Workflow Execution**
   - [ ] Lint job completes successfully
   - [ ] Test job completes with coverage
   - [ ] Build job completes with artifacts
   - [ ] Caching works correctly
   - [ ] Total runtime is reasonable (<10 minutes)

### Expected Workflow Results
- ✅ **Lint Job**: Passes with zero warnings
- ✅ **Test Job**: Passes with 85%+ coverage
- ✅ **Build Job**: Produces artifacts for both packages
- ✅ **Caching**: Cache hit/miss ratios are optimal
- ✅ **Artifacts**: Coverage reports and build outputs uploaded

## Branch Protection Validation

### Required Settings Check
- [ ] Branch protection rule exists for `staging`
- [ ] Require PR before merging: ✅ Enabled
- [ ] Require status checks: ✅ Enabled
  - [ ] `lint` check required
  - [ ] `test` check required  
  - [ ] `build` check required
- [ ] Require conversation resolution: ✅ Enabled
- [ ] Require linear history: ✅ Enabled (recommended)

### Access Control Check
- [ ] Direct pushes to staging blocked
- [ ] Force pushes disabled
- [ ] Admin bypass disabled (recommended)

## Dependabot Validation

### Configuration Check
- [ ] Dependabot file exists: `.github/dependabot.yml`
- [ ] Updates configured for all package ecosystems
- [ ] Reasonable PR limits set
- [ ] Proper commit message formatting
- [ ] Scheduled for appropriate times

### First Run Validation
- [x] Dependabot creates initial PRs (may take 24-48 hours)
- [ ] PRs have proper labels and formatting
- [ ] CI runs successfully on Dependabot PRs

## Performance Benchmarks

### CI Pipeline Performance
- **Target Metrics**:
  - Total pipeline time: < 10 minutes
  - Cache hit rate: > 80%
  - Parallel job execution: ✅ Working
  - Resource usage: Reasonable

### Local Development Performance
- **Target Metrics**:
  - `pnpm install`: < 2 minutes
  - `pnpm lint`: < 30 seconds
  - `pnpm test`: < 2 minutes
  - `pnpm build`: < 3 minutes

## Security Validation

### Dependency Security
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Dependabot security updates enabled
- [ ] Regular security scanning scheduled

### Workflow Security
- [ ] No secrets exposed in logs
- [ ] Proper permission scopes
- [ ] Secure artifact handling

## Post-Implementation Monitoring

### Week 1 Checklist
- [ ] Monitor CI success rates
- [ ] Check cache performance
- [ ] Validate coverage trends
- [ ] Review Dependabot PRs

### Month 1 Checklist
- [ ] Analyze CI performance metrics
- [ ] Review team feedback
- [ ] Optimize any bottlenecks
- [ ] Update documentation as needed

## Rollback Plan

### If Critical Issues Arise
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   # Revert problematic changes
   git revert <commit-hash>
   git push origin staging
   ```

2. **Temporary Bypass**:
   - Temporarily disable branch protection if needed
   - Document all bypasses
   - Plan fix implementation

3. **Communication**:
   - Notify team of issues
   - Provide timeline for fixes
   - Document lessons learned

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Implementation Complete When:
- [ ] All local tests pass
- [ ] CI pipeline runs successfully
